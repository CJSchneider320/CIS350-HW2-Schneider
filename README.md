## List of interests
- I play a lot of video games, and I love finding new games for my friends and I to enjoy. Right now, I play a lot of Destiny 2, League of Legends, and Valorant.
- I am very interested in procedurally generated maps. One of my favorite games ever is The Binding of Isaac, and I would love to learn how the developers of that game made the seed system.
- I also really want to lean C#. I am a fan of object-oriented languages, and I know that C# is one of the most popular object-oriented languages.

### Techical Background
My favorite and most used language is Java. It could be that I learned it first, or it could be that Java is the language that I resonate with the best. I love object-oriented languages so Java fits the bill. I also am very familiar with python, though I am not a big fan of it. I also know a bit of C, but that language is tough for me to wrap my head around sometimes. I want to learn C++, C#, Kotlin, Ruby, and SQL pretty soon, as those all have different use cases amd they are all very common for their respective uses in a professional setting.
